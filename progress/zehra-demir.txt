Week 6
Created app.py file.
Inside app.py, created "appearances" and "players" tables.
Week 8
Added my tables to csv_to_sql_table.py and data folder.
Week 9
I changed the creation order of tables, fixed some foreign key mistakes, forgotten commas, and wrong data types. I changed club_games table's primary key. Also changed the content of csv_to_sql_table to handle Null values and changed the path of csv files. I created data_cleaning.ipynb to drop some unmatched rows and I writed new data to cleaned csv files.
Week 10
I added the necessary html files for routes and added two css files. I also updated the flask_app.py with different routes. I changed the database name in config.py.
Week 11
I updated my player table functionality with add, delete, sort_filter and player page htmls. I added some style to css file.
I added update player page with some css. I fixed some bugs. I did error handling for both add player and update player input types, same club id or player ids etc. I also changed the table queries because they did not have any foreign key contraints, so I added on update cascade and on delete cascade for every foreign key.
